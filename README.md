# Narrative Context Protocol (NCP)

**A Standardized Schema for Transporting Authorial Intent Across Multi-Agentic Systems**

**Narrative Context Protocol (NCP)** is an open, standardized JSON schema explicitly designed to transport and preserve authorial intent across diverse multi-agent storytelling systems. Developed through collaboration with the **Entertainment Technology Center** at the **University of Southern California**, NCP reliably captures and conveys narrative context, artistic voice, and thematic coherence across platforms, mediums, and autonomous agents.

At its core, NCP provides a **structured yet adaptable schema**, ensuring narratives retain their logical consistency and emotional depth, even when interpreted or extended by numerous interacting agents. By encoding narrative elements into clear, universally understood representations, NCP maintains the original intent of the author throughout dynamic, distributed narrative environments.

Additionally, NCP acts like a "blockchain-for-subtext," transparently tracking narrative contributions, modifications, and creative expansions. This ensures the original artistic voice and intent remain clear and traceable, regardless of the complexity or number of agents involved.

Built upon proven narrative theories and driven by emerging advancements in AI storytelling, NCP simplifies and standardizes complex narrative exchanges. It empowers storytellers, technologists, and creative communities in film, gaming, literature, interactive media, and generative AI environments to collaborate freely—without sacrificing coherence, authenticity, or the original author's vision.

## Purpose and Philosophy

As storytelling mediums evolve rapidly, maintaining a structured yet adaptable narrative model becomes increasingly vital. NCP meets this challenge by providing a comprehensive yet adaptable framework that supports narrative coherence while accommodating the complexities and dynamic requirements of modern storytelling methodologies.

By clearly delineating narrative structure (Subtext) from presentation (Storytelling), NCP preserves authorial intent while enabling adaptable delivery across diverse storytelling platforms.

### Authorship, AI, and Creative Intent

As AI-driven storytelling rapidly evolves, crucial questions emerge about authorship, originality, and rights. NCP addresses these concerns transparently, embedding authorial intent within its structure, ensuring creators' original decisions remain clearly documented and respected.

By borrowing concepts familiar to collaborative software development—such as transparent tracking of narrative revisions and collaborative decision-making—NCP preserves the integrity and clarity of each author's contributions. This open and collaborative approach safeguards authorship while fostering creativity and innovation.

With NCP, the often informal process of giving and receiving notes transforms into a clearly documented system. **Creators' decisions are recorded, attributed, and protected, preserving the integrity and originality of their contributions.** By maintaining authorial intent at its core, NCP not only safeguards authorship but also provides a robust and respectful foundation for collaborative storytelling in an increasingly AI-driven creative environment.
