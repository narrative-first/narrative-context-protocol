# Universal Narrative Model (UNM) - Terminology & Conceptual Differentiation  

## Key Terminology Changes  
To modernize narrative analysis and improve computational modeling, UNM introduces **new terminology that clarifies previous narrative structures**.  

| **Previous Term**         | **UNM Equivalent**         | **Why the Change?**                                      |
|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Change vs. Steadfast     | Relinquished vs. Maintained | More accurately describes the transformation process. |
| Mental Sex/Problem-solving Style               | Narrative Alignment      | Aligns with modern neuroscience for decision-making.  |
| Story Limit               | Narrative Field      | Aligns with modern neuroscience for decision-making.  |
| Signposts                | Transits                 | Frames storytelling as a dynamic interaction between objective and subjective realities.       |

### Terminology Specific to Serotonin-aligned Narratives

| **Previous Term**         | **UNM Equivalent**         | **Why the Change?**                                      |
|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Universe        | External Framing        | Clarifies that conflict arises from external conditions shaping the context, making it easier to see how setting influences problems. |
| Physics        | External Processing      | Shifts focus to dynamic action and interaction, ensuring the source of conflict is understood as movement and change rather than just activity. |
| Psychology     | Internal Processing      | Makes it immediately clear that conflict stems from patterns of thought and decision-making rather than an abstract mental state. |
| Mind           | Internal Framing         | Highlights how attitudes and beliefs create conflict by shaping perception, rather than treating them as fixed traits. | 
| Problem                            | Condition                          | Reflects a more neutral framing of narrative inequities. |
| Solution                           | Adjustment                         | Recognizes shifts in perspective rather than binary resolution. |
| Focus                              | Resistance                         | Highlights opposition to a problem rather than mere attention. |
| Direction                          | Flow                               | Captures the evolving movement of the narrative. |
| Story Goal                         | Story Intention                    | More accurately represents the driving force of the narrative. |
| Story Consequence                  | Story Overwhelm                    | Frames consequences as pressures influencing narrative arcs. |
| Story Dividends                    | Story Excitement                   | Emphasizes the payoff or anticipation within a narrative. |
| Story Costs                        | Story Pressure                     | Defines the weight of obstacles within a given narrative. |
| Story Forewarnings                 | Story Ennui                        | Reflects warning signs of stagnation or a need for change. |
| Story Requirements                 | Story Habituation                  | Describes conditions necessary to sustain the narrative flow. |
| Story Prerequisites                | Story Internalization              | Aligns with steps taken to integrate an evolving theme. |
| Story Preconditions                | Story Socialization                | Defines external expectations shaping the narrative. |

These updates ensure that UNM remains **flexible, precise, and compatible with AI-driven storytelling**.

## Why These Changes Matter  
- The **Relinquished vs. Maintained Dynamic** clarifies the state differential that exists between the beginning and end of a narrative.  
- **Narrative Alignment** ensures decision-making is framed in **cognitive processing terms** rather than what appears to be binary distinctions.  
- **Narrative Field** ensures the concept of space relating to time is more readily understood at the base level of the Storyform.
- **Structural enhancements** help integrate **AI modeling and interactive storytelling frameworks**.
