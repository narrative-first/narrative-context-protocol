# Contributing to the Narrative Context Protocol (NCP)

## Overview
The **Narrative Context Protocol (NCP)** is the open-source Dramatica storyform schema for preserving authorial intent across film, television, theatre, novels, games, and interactive experiences. This repository is the reference implementation for the schema and examples—there is no standalone app here.

## How to Contribute
We welcome contributions that improve the schema, examples, documentation, and validation tooling. Proposed changes should maintain cross-medium applicability and keep JSON/YAML definitions in sync.

## Governance & Review
NCP was developed in collaboration with the **Entertainment Technology Center (ETC) at the University of Southern California** and is stewarded by **Narrative First** (The Dramatica Co.). Core maintainers lead reviews and incorporate community and partner feedback.

### 1. Submitting Issues & Proposals
- File ideas and bugs in the **Issues** tab with clear context, motivation, and sample payloads when possible.
- For schema changes, note any backward compatibility considerations and update relevant examples.

### 2. Review Process
- Narrative First maintainers perform technical and editorial reviews.
- Community discussion is encouraged; consensus on cross-medium impact is prioritized.

### 3. Licensing
- Contributions fall under the **MIT License**.
- By contributing, you agree to open access and broad adoption of the schema.
